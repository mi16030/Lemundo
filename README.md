# Lemundo
Something similar to Limundooo, but shhhh :)

## So what is Lemundo?
Lemundo is more of a demonstration of an auction site than a real one :)
The idea is to illustrate the auctioning process where several parties are interested in a certain product and they compete for it by offering prices.
The winner is the person who offers the most when the countdown is over and he wins the item for 10 RSD more than the person who offered less.
The thrill is in not knowing the highest offer. By this rule, we only know the second highest offer. 

## How does it go?
On the start page you can choose which category to browse, to see all auctions or to see your wishlist. You can add items to your wishlist by clicking the 'Dodaj u listu zelja' button. Oh, yeah, everything is in serbian, despite the english info. Sorry. But hey, now you know that wishist is called lista zelja in serbian. How cool is that?

Don't mind the one seller per category trait. Completely normal. Nothing shady going on there.

Now, you can click on 'Pogledaj aukciju' to look at the auction. You can see the description and facts about the product as well as the seller name. But be quick, because once you enter, 
the timer starts. You have 59 seconds to compete with others for the item. If you win, and dare I say, it's an ego boost to win (eventhough it's shhh not real), you will be redirected to a form where you need to enter your information and submit it. And that's all, folks.

## How do you start it?
Presuming you have angular and have installed the necesarry packages, just ng serve :)
